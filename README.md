# RISK-GPT: Reliable risk factors database of all diseases can be constructed based on Chat-GPT

Individuals may resort to online searches for disease risk factors to gain guidance on the prevention and management of a particular illness. However, such information sources can be limited and prone to misinterpretation. This study aims to determine whether a reliable risk factors database can be built through the utilization of the ChatGPT, a dialogue-based artificial intelligence language model with surpassing information extraction abilities

The demo of RISK-GPT database (Pre-release Version 0.2.11) was available on https://chatgptmodel.shinyapps.io/riskgpt/
